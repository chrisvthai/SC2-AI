# SC2 AI
This is a project heavily based on sentdex's tutorial on building and training a neural network in python to play Starcraft II. I just changed the different units and timings that the bot would use to play, as someone who's played Starcraft II a lot in the past.

Currently the neural network has about a 60% winrate against Hard difficulty Terran bots. This project will be updated as I change some more specific in-game build orders, update with sentdex's tutorials, etc.
